## 🚨 The Problem: "Flaky Tests exist because Debugging is Hard"

Modern QA automation is broken. When a test fails, engineers spend hours digging through logs to answer 3 simple questions:

1. **Is it a real bug?** (Or just network fluff?)
2. **What changed?** (Locator drift? CSS update?)
3. **How do I fix it?**

Most "AI" solutions are black boxes. **We believe in Explainability.**

## 💡 The Solution: Intelligent Healing

The **LM Studio QA Agent** doesn't just "fix" tests—it behaves like a Senior QA Engineer:

1. **Investigates**: Runs tests and captures high-fidelity evidence (logs, DOM snippets, screenshots).
2. **Diagnoses**: Uses **Enhanced Heuristics** for instant detection of timeouts, network errors (404/500), and JS crashes.
3. **Reasoning**: Consults an LLM (guided by heuristics and externalized prompts) to plan a fix.
4. **Explains**: Outputs structured **Execution Timelines** and **Decision JSON** proving _why_ it made the change.

## ✨ Features

- **Test Generation**: Scrapes web pages and generates runnable Playwright TypeScript tests.
- **Vision Agent**: Uses vision-capable LLMs (e.g., Qwen-VL) to understand UI from screenshots.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically fixes broken tests by analyzing error logs and updating selectors.
- **Enhanced Heuristics**: Deterministically identifies network errors, JavaScript runtime errors, and locator drift.
- **Customizable Prompts**: All LLM system instructions are externalized in the `prompts/` directory for easy tweaking.
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for URLs, file paths, and user inputs.
- **Standard UI**: Clean, minimal Gradio interface following standard design patterns.

## 📈 Understanding Confidence Scores

The agent assigns a **Confidence Score (0.0 - 1.0)** to every diagnosis:

- **1.0 (Certain)**: The failure matched a **Deterministic Heuristic** (Regex). No guessing involved.
- **0.8 - 0.9 (Strong)**: The LLM identified the issue with high certainty based on logs and code context.
- **< 0.7 (Low)**: The failure is ambiguous; the agent is proposing a "best-guess" fix that requires human review.

## 🚀 Setup

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the application is using Docker.

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t qa-agent .

# Run the container
docker run -p 7860:7860 \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e LM_STUDIO_URL="http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1" \
  qa-agent
```

Access the Gradio interface at `http://localhost:7860`. See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for more info.

### Option 2: Local Installation

1. **Install Python Dependencies** (Python 3.11+ recommended):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install Node.js Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npx playwright install
   ```

3. **Configure LM Studio**:
   Ensure LM Studio is running and models (e.g., Qwen-Coder, Qwen-VL) are loaded at `http://localhost:1234/v1`.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Launch the UI

```bash
python src/app.py
```

Go to `http://127.0.0.1:7860` to generate, run, and heal tests.

### Running Agents Individually

```bash
python -m src.agents.healer tests/generated/broken_example.spec.ts
```

## 🧪 Example Scenarios

1. **Form Authentication**: [The Internet Login](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login). Proves handling of standard forms.
2. **Dynamic React Apps**: [TodoMVC](https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/). Demonstrates client-side rendered app support.
3. **Real-world Search**: [Wikipedia AI Search](https://www.wikipedia.org). Validates multi-step verification.
4. **Vision Agent**: [SauceDemo Vision](https://www.saucedemo.com). Uses screenshots to identify elements.
5. **Self-Healer**: Automatically repairs incorrect selectors by analyzing logs. Try intentionally breaking a script and watching it heal!

## ⚙️ Configuration & Quality Control

### Environment Variables

See [ENV_VARIABLES.md](ENV_VARIABLES.md) for full documentation on `LM_STUDIO_URL`, `DEFAULT_MODEL`, etc.

### Customizable Prompts

Edit the files in `prompts/` to tweak agent behavior without changing code:

- `generator.md`, `healer.md`, `vision.md`.

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run lint      # Run all quality checks
npm run test:unit # Run Python unit tests
npm run format    # Auto-format all code
```

## 🔒 Security

- Input validation prevents malicious URLs and path traversal.
- File operations restricted to allowed directories.
- Subprocess calls use proper sanitization.
