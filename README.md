## Problem Statement

Modern QA automation faces significant scalability challenges. When tests fail, engineering teams invest substantial time analyzing logs to distinguish between:

1. **Application Defects**: Genuine regressions or bugs.
2. **Environment Issues**: Network latency or service unavailability.
3. **Test Flakiness**: Locator drift or race conditions.

Many existing AI-based solutions operate as "black boxes," automatically patching code without providing insight into the decision-making process. **This lack of explainability inhibits trust and complicates long-term maintenance.**

## Solution Overview

The **Autonomous Test Repair System** is an intelligent agent designed to reduce test maintenance overhead through automated diagnosis and remediation. It emulates senior-level QA capabilities by executing a four-stage pipeline:

1. **Investigate**: Captures high-fidelity evidence (logs, DOM trees, screenshots) during test execution.
2. **Diagnose**: Utilizes **Deterministic Heuristics** for instant identification of common failures (timeouts, network errors) and **LLM Analysis** for complex logic.
3. **Reason**: Synthesizes evidence to formulate a remediation plan, documented in a structured JSON artifact.
4. **Act & Explain**: Applies the fix and generates a detailed **Execution Timeline**, proving the validity of the change.

## Key Differentiators

What sets this autonomous agent apart from standard test automation tools?

- **Transparent Reasoning**: Every fix includes a `HealingDecision` JSON artifact, allowing you to trace exactly why a specific change was made.
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines **Deterministic Heuristics** (Regex) for instant, low-cost error detection with **LLM Reasoning** for complex logic, optimizing both speed and cost.
- **Production-Ready Toolchain**: Ships with a proven quality control pipeline (ESLint 9, Flake8, Husky, lint-staged) to ensure maintainable, industry-standard code.
- **Multimodal Analysis**: When DOM scraping falls short, the **Vision Agent** analyzes screenshots to understand UI layout and context, mimicking human visual verification.

---

## Features

- **Automated Test Generation**: Analyzes DOM structures to generate robust Playwright TypeScript test suites.
- **Vision Agent**: Uses vision-capable LLMs (e.g., Qwen-VL) to understand UI from screenshots.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically fixes broken tests by analyzing error logs and updating selectors.
- **Enhanced Heuristics**: Deterministically identifies network errors, JavaScript runtime errors, and locator drift.
- **Customizable Prompts**: All LLM system instructions are externalized in the `prompts/` directory for easy tweaking.
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for URLs, file paths, and user inputs.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Centralized Gradio interface for managing test generation, vision context, and healing operations.

---

## Confidence Scoring System

The agent assigns a **Confidence Score (0.0 - 1.0)** to every diagnosis to facilitate risk assessment:

- **1.0 (Deterministic)**: The failure matched a verified pattern (e.g., specific error codes). No probabilistic reasoning involved.
- **0.8 - 0.9 (High)**: The LLM identified the root cause with strong evidence from logs and code context.
- **< 0.7 (Low)**: The failure is ambiguous; the agent is proposing a "best-guess" fix that requires human review.

## Setup

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the application is using Docker.

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t autonomoustestrepairsystem .

# Run the container
docker run -p 7860:7860 \
  --name autonomoustestrepairsystem \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e LM_STUDIO_URL="http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1" \
  -e LLM_PROVIDER="lm_studio" \
  autonomoustestrepairsystem
```

**Or with Ollama:**

```bash
docker run -p 7860:7860 \
  --name autonomoustestrepairsystem \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e OLLAMA_URL="http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1" \
  -e LLM_PROVIDER="ollama" \
  autonomoustestrepairsystem
```

Access the Gradio interface at `http://localhost:7860`. See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for more info.

### Option 2: Local Installation

1. **Install Python Dependencies** (Python 3.11+ recommended):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install Node.js Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npx playwright install
   ```

3. **Configure LLM Provider**:
   Create a `.env` file and set `LLM_PROVIDER` to either `lm_studio` or `ollama`. Configure the corresponding URL and models.

## Usage

### Launch the UI

```bash
python src/app.py
```

### Running Agents Individually

```bash
python -m src.agents.healer tests/generated/broken_example.spec.ts
```

- **Goal**: Validates search interactions and multiple verification steps on professional sites.

### 4. Vision Agent

- **URL**: [https://www.saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com)
- **Scenario**: Login with `standard_user` / `secret_sauce`.
- **Goal**: Uses visual analysis to identify elements without relying solely on HTML source.

### 5. Self-Healer

- **Input**: A broken test file like `broken_example.spec.ts`.
- **Command**: `python -m src.agents.healer tests/generated/broken_example.spec.ts`
- **Goal**: Automatically repairs incorrect selectors and labels by analyzing Playwright error logs.
- **Deep Dive**: See [HEALING_SCENARIOS.md](docs/HEALING_SCENARIOS.md) for a detailed breakdown of how the agent resolves specific failures like Locator Drift, Network Flakiness, and Race Conditions.
- **Trial**: To see it in action, purposefully introduce mistakes into the locator IDs or button names in the script and watch the agent heal them!

## Configuration & Quality Control

### Environment Variables

See [ENV_VARIABLES.md](ENV_VARIABLES.md) for full documentation on `LM_STUDIO_URL`, `DEFAULT_MODEL`, etc.

### Customizable Prompts

Edit the files in `prompts/` to tweak agent behavior without changing code:

- `generator.md`, `healer.md`, `vision.md`.

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run lint      # Run all quality checks
npm run test:unit # Run Python unit tests
npm run format    # Auto-format all code
```

### Tooling Stack

- **TypeScript/JS**: Prettier + ESLint (v9 Flat Config) + Playwright Plugin
- **Python**: Black + isort + Flake8
- **Documentation**: Markdownlint
- **Automation**: Husky (Git Hooks) + lint-staged

## Security

- Input validation prevents malicious URLs and path traversal.
- File operations restricted to allowed directories.
- Subprocess calls use proper sanitization.
